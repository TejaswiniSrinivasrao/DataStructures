What is an array?

The most basic yet important data structure is the array. It is a linear data structure. An array is a collection of 
homogeneous data types where the elements are allocated contiguous memory. Because of the contiguous allocation of memory, 
any element of an array can be accessed in constant time. Each array element has a corresponding index number. 


Reverse Array – Reverse an array means shifting the elements of an array in a reverse manner i.e., 
the last element becomes the first element, second last element becomes the second element, and so on. 

Rotation of Array – Rotation of array means shifting the elements of an array in a circular manner i.e., 
in the case of right circular shift the last element becomes the first element, and all other element moves one point to the right. 

Rearranging an array – Rearrangement of array elements suggests the changing of an initial order of elements 
following some conditions or operations.

Range queries in the array – Often you need to perform operations on a range of elements. 
These functions are known as range queries.

Multidimensional array – These are arrays having more than one dimension. The most used one is the 2-dimensional array, commonly known as a matrix.


Basic terminologies of array
______________________________

Array Index: In an array, elements are identified by their indexes. Array index starts from 0.
Array element: Elements are items stored in an array and can be accessed by their index.
Array Length: The length of an array is determined by the number of elements it can contain.


Types of Array operations:
___________________________

Traversal: Traverse through the elements of an array.
Insertion: Inserting a new element in an array.
Deletion: Deleting element from the array.
Searching:  Search for an element in the array.
Sorting: Maintaining the order of elements in the array.

Advantages of using Arrays:
_____________________________
Arrays allow random access to elements. This makes accessing elements by position faster.
Arrays have better cache locality which makes a pretty big difference in performance.
Arrays represent multiple data items of the same type using a single name.
Arrays store multiple data of similar types with the same name.
Array data structures are used to implement the other data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.

Disadvantages of Array:
________________________
As arrays have a fixed size, once the memory is allocated to them, it cannot be increased or decreased, making it impossible to store extra data if required. An array of fixed size is referred to as a static array. 
Allocating less memory than required to an array leads to loss of data.
An array is homogeneous in nature so, a single array cannot store values of different data types. 
Arrays store data in contiguous memory locations, which makes deletion and insertion very difficult to implement. This problem is overcome by implementing linked lists, which allow elements to be accessed randomly.  
Application of Array:
They are used in the implementation of other data structures such as array lists, heaps, hash tables, vectors, and matrices.
Database records are usually implemented as arrays.
It is used in lookup tables by computer.
It is used for different sorting algorithms such as bubble sort insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.
