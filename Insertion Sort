/* Insertion.sort
----------------
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards 
in your hands.

Worst complexity: n^2
Average complexity: n^2
Best complexity: n
Space complexity: 1

{12, 11, 13, 5, 6}

1. i = 11, so key = 11 j=12 then 12>11 
so arr[j+1] = a[j] => here we are setting j=12
j=j-1; j=0

j+1 = 0+1 = key = 11
{11,12,13,5,6}


Consider an example: arr[]: {12, 11, 13, 5, 6}

   12   	   11   	   13   	   5   	   6   
First Pass:

Initially, the first two elements of the array are compared in insertion sort.
   12   	   11   	   13   	   5   	   6   
Here, 12 is greater than 11 hence they are not in the ascending order and 12 is not at its correct position. Thus, swap 11 and 12.
So, for now 11 is stored in a sorted sub-array.
   11   	   12   	   13   	   5   	   6   
Second Pass:

 Now, move to the next two elements and compare them
   11   	   12   	   13   	   5   	   6   
Here, 13 is greater than 12, thus both elements seems to be in ascending order, hence, no swapping will occur. 12 also stored in a sorted sub-array along with 11
Third Pass:

Now, two elements are present in the sorted sub-array which are 11 and 12
Moving forward to the next two elements which are 13 and 5
   11   	   12   	   13   	   5   	   6   
Both 5 and 13 are not present at their correct place so swap them
   11   	   12   	   5   	   13   	   6   
After swapping, elements 12 and 5 are not sorted, thus swap again
   11   	   5   	   12   	   13   	   6   
Here, again 11 and 5 are not sorted, hence swap again
   5   	   11   	   12   	   13   	   6   
here, it is at its correct position
Fourth Pass:

Now, the elements which are present in the sorted sub-array are 5, 11 and 12
Moving to the next two elements 13 and 6
   5   	   11   	   12   	   13   	   6   
Clearly, they are not sorted, thus perform swap between both
   5   	   11   	   12   	   6   	   13   
Now, 6 is smaller than 12, hence, swap again
   5   	   11   	   6   	   12   	   13   
Here, also swapping makes 11 and 6 unsorted hence, swap again
   5   	   6   	   11   	   12   	   13   
Finally, the array is completely sorted.
Code for Insertion Sort:
_________________________*/

function insertionSort(arr, n) {
  let i, key, j;
  for (i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    key = arr[i];
    j = i - 1;

    /* Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are 
        greater than key, to one position ahead 
        of their current position */
    while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
      arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
      j = j - 1;
    }
    arr[j + 1] = key;
  }
}

// A utility function to print an array of size n
function printArray(arr, n) {
  let i;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) document.write(arr[i] + " ");
  document.write("<br>");
}

// Driver code
let arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6];
let n = arr.length;

insertionSort(arr, n);
printArray(arr, n);

/* Here we are looping through the array elements

1. let i= 1 second elemnt in the Array={}
2. Element at the arr[i] is set to cuurent value[key]
3. j index is set to i-1
4. here we can use for loop to but we are using while loop
5.in while loop we are checking index of j >0 and value at the index is greater then we are setting the value to
current value and setting j=j-1 and setting the a[j+1] to current value.
